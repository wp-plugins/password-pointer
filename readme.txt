Creates a pointer that nags users to change their password.

== Description ==

When I create new users, I give them a randomly generated password. I always ask them to change it to something they'll remember, but most don't know where to do this. This plugin will (hopefully) fix that.

Once they click "close" they won't see the nag again.
