Creates a pointer that nags users to change their password.

== Description ==

When I build sites for clients, I create their user and give them a randomly generated password. I always ask them to change it to something they'll remember, but most don't know where to do this. This plugin will (hopefully) fix that.

Once they click "close" they won't see the nag again.

== Screenshots ==

1. The pointer points to their name in the top right corner, which they can click to edit their profile.

== Changelog ==

**Version 0.1**

* This is version 0.1.  Everything's new!
